**Task**

1. Examine the screenshot closely for any rendering or runtime errors (e.g., "404 Not Found", stack traces, missing styles, blank areas).
2. Decide whether the screenshot *shows a rendering or runtime error*.

   * If **yes**, set `"is_error": true`, extract or paraphrase the visible error message(s) into `"error_message"`, and leave `"screenshot_description"` empty.
   * If **no**, set `"is_error": false`, leave `"error_message"` as an empty string (`""`), and write a concise but thorough `"screenshot_description"` that covers:

     * Overall layout (e.g., header/sidebar/footer, grid, flex, single-column).
     * Key UI components (navigation bar, buttons, forms, images, cards, tables, modals, etc.).
     * Color scheme and visual style (dominant colors, light/dark theme, gradients, shadows).
     * Visible content and text (headings, labels, sample data).
     * Notable design details (icons, spacing, font style) that help someone understand what the page looks like.
3. Suggest ways to improve the appearance of the website, for example:

   * Separate incorrectly overlapping components.
   * Adjust layout to avoid large blank areas.
   * Adjust text or background color to avoid text color being too similar to the background color.
   * If no improvement is necessary, leave `"suggestions"` as an empty string (`""`); otherwise, briefly list the suggestion(s) in `"suggestions"`.
4. Grade the 
**Output format (valid JSON)**

```json
{
  "is_error": <boolean>,
  "error_message": "<string>",
  "screenshot_description": "<string>",
  "suggestions": "<string>"
}

Return **only** this JSON object—no additional commentary, markdown, or code fences.

Instruction:
You are tasked with evaluating the functional design of a webpage. Grade the webpage's appearance on a scale of 0 to 5 (5 being highest), considering the following criteria:

  - Successful Rendering: Are there any components in the page or is it completely blank? Does the webpage render correctly without visual errors? Are colors, fonts, and components displayed as specified?
  - Content Relevance: Does the design align with the website’s purpose and user requirements? Are elements (e.g., search bars, report formats) logically placed and functional?
  - Layout Harmony: Is the arrangement of components (text, images, buttons) balanced, intuitive, and clutter-free?
  - Modernness & Beauty: Does the design follow contemporary trends (e.g., minimalism, responsive layouts)? Are colors, typography, and visual hierarchy aesthetically pleasing?

Grading Scale:

  - 0 (Blank Page): The screenshot is completely blank or does not contain any visible content. It may only have a background color or display an error message.
  - 1 (Poor): Major rendering issues (e.g., broken layouts, incorrect colors). Content is irrelevant or missing. Layout is chaotic. Design is outdated or visually unappealing.
  - 2 (Below Average): Partial rendering with noticeable errors. Content is partially relevant but poorly organized. Layout lacks consistency. Design is basic or uninspired.
  - 3 (Average): Mostly rendered correctly with minor flaws. Content is relevant but lacks polish. Layout is functional but unremarkable. Design is clean but lacks modern flair.
  - 4 (Good): Rendered well with no major errors. Content is relevant and logically organized. Layout is harmonious and user-friendly. Design is modern and visually appealing.
  - 5 (Excellent): Flawless rendering. Content is highly relevant, intuitive, and tailored to user needs. Layout is polished, responsive, and innovative. Design is cutting-edge, beautiful, and memorable.

Task:
Review the provided screenshot(s) of the webpage. Provide a concise analysis of a few sentences and then assign a grade (1–5) based on your analysis. Highlight strengths, weaknesses, and how well the design adheres to the specifications.
